# ideas for machines

** Machine for refugees **

A machine that floats in the ocean and picks up the trash and plastic debris it finds, turning it into rafts for refugees.

** Domino Stacking Machine **

Machine that turns any image into a domino stack. You define the image and size and it prints it on a large floor.
