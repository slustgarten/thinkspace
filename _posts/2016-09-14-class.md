# Project Management


**synchronization**

bring two computers into same state without history

** version control **

bring two computers into same state with a history

git: maintains history, branches, peer-to-peer (server for class site is just one more version, can sync between peers and so on)

merge changes between different versions

neal does things at lowest level to keep control (so, HTML instead)

worflow: pull, work, pull, push

document as you go


#Computer-Controlled Cutting

** vinylcutter **

cut with a knife

you can do whatever you make with exacto

can make vynil stickers for laptop

parameters: angle of cut of knife

** laser cutter **

most used 

** waterjet **

expensive, like laser but works on other materials (rocks, stone, etc)

** hot wire **

cuts hardest materials (core components of machines, etc)

### for project
make design to account for beam diameter and diameret of cardboard

** inkscape **

good for this week's assignment because you can clone an object and use it on design, then if you change that object you can adjust sizes and it changes all parameters.

** antimony **
you can also use antimony for this and if you do it a parametric design, then changes on board propagates through

** printing **
once you have design have to turn it into a file for printing. since each printer has a different driver, you can use http://fabmodules.org/ to convert 

** lasercutter**

raster

vector

halftone (continuous tone image --> turned into dots) can be used to print pictures like newspapers, but make stencil for tshirts etc

make construction kit: can be used to make more than 1 thing (like lego)

3d assembly of 2d parts

round corners are nicer/easier to put together through slots so chanfering 

in antimony, adding a script node allows you to add variables

edge crush test --> metric on cardboards. if it kins isn't good for prototyping. if it doesn't, then it it.

don't cut material with laser cutter unless you know its pedigree (i.e. pvc is terrible)

after using laser cutter, let it run for 1 or 2 minutes for it to extrude all smell... otherwise it smells.


rastering --> mostly for artwork
vector --> mainly for what we do
halftone --> printing masks, etc

#version control

I've used codecademy to go through their git tutorial.

The following is a list of useful commands:

**git init** creates a new Git repository
**git status** inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
**git add** adds files from the working directory to the staging area
**git diff** shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
**git commit** permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
**git log** shows a list of all previous commits
